I remotely supervised the testing and personally reviewed all the information collected and available and this is my impression: SSEPs: UE: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses (including N20 waveforms) with sub-cortical cervical and peripheral preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal column nuclei, most likely at the cortical level. LE: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripheral preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal column nuclei, most likely at the cortical level. BAEPs: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for absence of responses beyond of wave I, bilaterally, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the vestibulo-cochlear nuclei, on both sides. IMPRESSION: This pattern of SEPs with absence of cortical responses with preserved sub-cortical cervical and peripherals, as well as BAEPs absent except for bilateral presence of wave I, in absence of hypo- thermia, or effect of any psychotrophic medication, it is known as 'brain death' or 'cerebral death' pattern.",,,,,,No,,,Unknown,Tox vs other,No,,Yes,8/27/12,,,17,31,,Long-term acute

I remotely supervised the testing, and personally reviewed the information collected and available and this is my impression. SSEPs: UE: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials with morphology, latencies (N20s: MS: 21.3 ms, MD: 21.0 ms), amplitude and L/R differences within NORMAL limits for the age range.

I remotely supervised the testing and personally reviwed the information collected and available and these are my impressions: MS: No cortical responses were identified (including N20 waveforms). Sub-cortical responses were identified at 15.0 and 11.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses were identified (including N20 waveforms). Sub-cortical responses were identified at 15.0 and 11.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. IMPRESSION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervicals and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, bilaterally. TS: No cortical responses were identified. A sub-cortical response was identified at 6.0 at the popliteal point. TD: No cortical responses were identified. A sub-cortical response was identified at 6.0 at the popliteal point. IMPRESSION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervicals and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, bilaterally. AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.6, 4.8 and 6.9 ms,respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.4, 4.6 and 6.7 ms, respectively. IMPRESSION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 16.3 and 9.7 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for abscense of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both hemispheres.

16:59,Bilaterally absent N20,"We just performed SSEPs (UE+LE) and BAEPs on this 61 yo F who suffered a cardiac arrest. I remotely supervised the testing, but personally reviewed the information collected and available and these are my impressions: SSEPs: MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.2  and 7.5 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identi- fied. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.2 and 6.0 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median Neves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses (inclduing the N20 waveform) with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal co- lumns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, BILATERAL.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 21.0  and 8.2 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be  identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 21.3 and 8.2 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial Neves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely  at the cortical level, BILATERAL. BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.0, 3.9 and 5.4 ms respectively. AD: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.8, 3.8  and 5.3 ms respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals, L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies suggest extense, bi-hemispheric, para-median and convexity lesion of  both Parietal cortices with preserved electrocortical brainstem function, as can be seen on hypoxic/ ischemic encephalopathies.",,,,,,No,,,Unknown,Respiratory vs. shock vs other,No,,No,,7/24/13,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,4,4,,,,,,Yes,No,07212013-006,No potential as a

encephalopathy secondary to a cardio-respiratory arrest apparently induced by drug intoxication. I remotely supervised the testing but personally checked the recorded and available information and this is my impression:   SSEPs: MS: No cortical responses (including the N20 responses) could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.6 and 10.8 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses (including the N20 responses) could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.8 and 10.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on both hemispheres. TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 26.7 and 8.3 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.6 and 9.3 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on both hemispheres. BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.9, 4.3 and 6.4 ms, res- pectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.1, 4.1 and  6.4 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology, but with peak-la- tencies, inter-peak intervals, L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies suggest an extense, severe, BI-HEMISPHERIC, Parietal cortex lesions, with preservation of the electrophysiological brainstem function, like the ones that can be seen on a hypoxic/ ischemic encephalopathy.",No,,,,,No,,,Toxicological,,No,,No,,9/13/13,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,14,14,,,,,,Yes,No,08312013-035,No potential as a

and BAEPs on this 57 yo Male who suffered a severe  TBI with apparent posterior cardiac arrest. I remotely supervised the testing, but  personally, checked all the information collected and available, and these are my  impressions: SSEPs: MS: 0 cortical responses (including the N20 responses) could be identified. Sub- cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.3 and 7.5 ms at the cervical and Erb's  points, respectively. MD: 0 cortical responses (including the N20 responses) could  be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.2 and 7.2 ms at the  cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median Nerves AB0RMAL for absen- ce of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, sug- gestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both sides. TS: 0 cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were re- corded at 22.5 and 6.8 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: 0  cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at  23.7 and 6.8 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial Nerves AB0RMAL for absen- ce of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, sug- gestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above  the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both sides. BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.1,  5.2 and 7.0 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were iden- tified at peak latencies of 1.9, 4.5 and 7.2 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology, but,  AB0RMAL for delayed peak latencies beyond wave I on both sides, as well as, prolon- ged inter-peak intervals I-III and I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of a lesion or  compression of the auditory pathways at the level of the upper Medulla/lower Pons, bi- teral, but a little higher on the Right side.  IMPRESSION: The results of these studies suggest an extensive, bilateral lesion of the Parietal Cortex, paramedially and in the convexity, o both hesmispheres with compromise of the electrophysiological brainstem function, like the ones that can be seen in mixed, or independently on a0xyc/ischemic and/or poli-traumatic encephalopathies.",,,,,,No,,,Unknown,Trauma vs

N20,"We performed SSEPs (UE+LE) and BAEPs on this 55 yo F who apparently suffered a cardiac arrest. I remotely supervised the testing but personally checked all the information recorded and available and this is my impression: SSEPs: MS: A cortical negative-positive-negative complex was recorded with latency for N20 wa-  veform of 25.3 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.7 and 11.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-posi- tive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 23.7 and 31.2  ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.3 and 10.8 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential of the Left Median Nerve ABNORMAL for par- tial absence of the cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preser- ved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of the Tha- lamus on the RIGHT hemisphere. The SEP elicited when the Right Median nerve was stimulated is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: A cortical positive-negative complex was recorded with latency for P40 waveform of   53.5 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 24.0 and 7.2 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: A cortical positive-negative complex was recorded with  latency for the P40 waveform of 58.5 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 28.7  and 6.2 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial Nerves ABNORMAL for partial absen- ce of the cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, sugges- tive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathways at the level of the Thalamus, on both hemispheres.  BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.5, 4.1 and 6.3 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at  peak latencies of 2.2, 4.4 and 6.5 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, in- ter-peak intervals, L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL liimits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies suggest bilateral, partial compromise of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres, except at the convexity of the Left hemisphere, with preserved electro- graphic brainstem function, like the ones that can be seen in hypoxic/ischemic encephalopa- thy.

I remotely supervised the testing but personally checked the collected and available information and this is my interpretation: SSEPs: MS: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latency for the N20 waveform of 26.0 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.2 and 10.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latency for the N 20 waveform of 26.3 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.8 and 9.8 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: 0isy Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves with appropriate morphology, but AB0RMAL for prolonged latencies at all levels, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of the peripheral nerves.  TS: 0 cortical/subcortical responses could be identified. TD: 0 cortical/subcortical responses could be identified. BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.3, 5.2 and 7.2 ms, respec- tively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.9, 4.1 and 5.8 ms, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology, but AB0RMAL for delayed peak latencies of all waves on the Left side, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals I-III and I-V also on the Left side, suggestive of a lesion or compression on the auditory pathway at the level of the  upper Medulla/lower Pons on the LEFT side. The BAEP elicited when the Right ear was stimulated is within 0RMAL limits.  OPINION: These studies are suggestive of a bilateral, patchy compromise of the cortex, with major com- promise at the convexity than paramedial, with partially preserved electrographic brainstem activty as it can be seen on ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathies.

I remotely supervised the testing, but personally reviewed all the information  collected and available and these are my impressions:  SSEPs: Upper extremities: MS: 0 cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recor- ded at 13.0 and 9.0 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: 0 cortical  responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.0 and  8.5 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves very AB0RMAL for ab- sence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervicals and peripherals preserved, sug- gestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above, the  dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both sides. Lower extremities: TS: 0 cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recor- ded at 24.0 and 8.0 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: 0 cor- tical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 25.0  and 8.5 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves very AB0RMAL for ab- sence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervicals and peripherals preserved, sug- gestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above, the  dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both sides.  BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.6, 4.4 and 6.1 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at  peak latencies of 1.7, 4.3 and 6.2 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, in- ter-peak intervals, L/R differences and ratios within 0RMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: The results of the previous tests suggest extense, bi-hemispheric, Parietal cortex lesions with compromise of the convexities, as well as, the paramedian areas. It exists preservation of the electrographic brainstem function. The previous findings could be considered almost patog0monic of hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. The bilateral absen- ce of the N-20 cortical response on the Median nerve SSEPs have been found to correlate  with bad neurological and survival

Sub-cortical negative waves were re- corded at 13.3 and 9.7 ms, at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median Nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathways at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, bilaterally.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were re- corded at 27.0 and 8.3 ms, at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.

INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials of the RIGHT ear with acceptable morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latency of wave V, as well as, prolonged in- ter-peak intervals III-V and I-V, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Pons/lower Midbrain on the RIGHT side.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 19.7 and 13.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves very ABNORMAL for absen- ce of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved but delayed,  suggestive of lesions or compressions of the neural pathways at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on both hemispheres, as well  as, at the level of the peripheral nerve, also on both sides.  LE: No responses could be registered from the Tibial nerves. There existed important amount of oedema at the distal segments of both lower extremities.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.7 and 10.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded  at 15.3 and 10.0 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of the RIGHT Median nerve ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above  the dorsal column nucleus, most likely at the cortical level, on the LEFT hemisphere. The SEP elicited from the LEFT Median nerve is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: A cortical positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the P45 waveform of 50.0 ms. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 28.7 and 8.0 ms  at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded  at 32.0 and 9.0 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.

The SEP elicited from the LEFT Tibial nerve is within NORMAL limits for the age range.

AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.5, 5.1 and 6.8 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with appropriate morphology, but slightly ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of all waveforms on both side, as well as,  prolonged interpeak intervals I-III, III-V, and I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of  a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the peripheral nerve on  both sides, or most likely acceptable responses on a person with age related neuro-senso rial hypoacusis.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 15.8 and 11.8 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortcal level, on both hemispheres.  TS: No cortical responses were identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 34.0 and 9.0 ms  at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses were identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 35.0 and 9.3 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortcal level, on both hemispheres.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear responses: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.5, 4.6 and 7.2 ms, respec- tively. AD: Right ear responses: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.6, 4.5 and 8.1 ms, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of wave V on both sides, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals III-V and I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Pons/ lower Midbrain, on both sides, but worse on the Right one.  IMPRESSION: The results of these studes point to an extensive, lesion of the Parietal cortex on both hemis- pheres, both at the paramedian and at the convexity levels, with no preservation of the electrographic brain- stem function. These findings are compatible with a sever hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.

I remotely supervised the testing, and personally reviewed all the information recorded and available, and this is my impression. Unfortunately the quality of the lo- wer extremity SEPs was not the best, given the presence of abundant noise, and this is the reason why is not reported.  SSEPs:  MS: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 24.0 and 29.7 ms, respectively. Sub-crtical negative waves were recorded at 13.7 and 10.7 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 24.0 and 32.3 ms, respectively. Sub-crtical negative waves were recorded at 13.0 and 10.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.

The BAEP elicited from the LEFT ear is within NORMAL limits for the age range.

after the  second one. Yesterday we performed SSEPS (UE+LE) and BAEPs. I remotely supervised the tesging but personally reivewed the information collected and available and this is my impression:  SSEPs:  MS: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 26.7 and 33.2 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.7 and 9.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the  N20 and P30 waveforms of 22.3 and 28.3 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.8 and 9.3  ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential of the Left Median nerve slightly ABNORMAL for delayed latency of  the cortical responses, with the sub-cortical and peripherals preserved and normal, suggestive of a lesion or compression  of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level of the RIGHT  hemisphere. The SEP elicited when the Right Median nerve was stimulated is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: A cortical positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the P40 and P60 waveforms of 39.3 and  61.2 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 24.7 and 7.3 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: A cortical positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the P40 and P60 waveforms  of 41.3 and 60.5 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 24.7 and 8.3 ms at the cervical and popli- teal points, respectively.    INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential of the Tibial nerves with morphology, latenciese, amplitude and L/R differences within NORMAL limits for the age range.  BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identifed at peak latencies of 2.3, 5.2 and 7.3 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identifed at peak latencies of 2.3, 5.3 and 6.8 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with appropriate morpology but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of waves III and V bilaterally, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals I-III, and I-V, also bilate- rally, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Medulla/lower Pons, bilateral, but worse on the LEFT side.  IMPRESSSION: These studies point to a mild, localized lesion/compression of the Parietal cortex of the the convexity of the Right hemisphere, with compromise of the electrophysiological brainstem function. These lesions could be the result of a hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy. The presence of one adequate and another inadequate N20 cortical responses of the Median nerve SEPs make the neurologic and survival prognoses of these patient uncertain.",No,,,,,No,,,Airway obstruction,,No,,Yes,4/6/14,,,0,13,,Long-term acute care,,4,5,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2014-064,52,Male,3/22/14,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,VT/VF,IV,Yes,,Westmoreland Regional Hospital,,Mutual Aid Ambulance Service,,,,STAT MedEvac,,,,3/22/14 8:48,PEA,Lay person witnessed,No,Yes,1,45,24,4,0,New supraglottic airway,Yes,Unable to determine,29251478,[document],,,29259133,[document],3/22/14 18:58,3F (CCU),,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Eyelids closed with pain,Myoclonus,Both reactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",33C,No,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,Alive and comatose,Eyelids closed with pain,Myoclonus,Both nonreactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,Unable to determine,,,,,,,Alive and comatose,Eyelids closed but open to pain,No response to pain,Both reactive,Both present,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",,,,,,,Alive and comatose,Eyelids closed with pain,No response to pain,Both nonreactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",,,,,,,Alive and comatose,Eyelids closed with pain,No response to pain,Both nonreactive,Both present,Absent,Absent,Unable to determine,,,,,,,Alive and comatose,Eyelids closed with pain,Flexion response to pain,Both reactive,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,3/25/14 15:44,Bilaterally absent N20,"Bedside somatosensory evoked pottentials in response to bilateral median and tibial nerve stimulation were recorded.

15:16,"One side present, one side absent","We just performed SSEPs (UE+LE) and BAEPs on this 53 yo F who apparently suffered a cardiac arrest. I remotely supervised the testing but personally reviewed the information collected and available and this is my interpretation. Unfortunately, the quality of the Upper extremity SSEPs is not the ideal, given the pre- sence of abundant movement artifact in the recordings:  SSEPs:  MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 11.8 and 7.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points. MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 30.7 and 41.0 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.5 and 8.8 ms, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence  of the RIGHT hemisphere, and delayed latencies in the LEFT, of the cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved on both sides, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level  of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei on the RIGHT, and most-likely at the cortical level on the LEFT.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 32.0 and 7.7 ms at the  cervical and popliteal points, respectively.  TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves  were recorded at 27.7 and 7.0 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete, absence of  cortical responses, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal  columns nuclei on both sides.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.0, 4.4 and 7.5 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.3, 4.4 and 6.7 ms, respectively.  INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of wave V on both sides, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervaks III-V and I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Pons/lower Midbrain, on both sides but worse on the LEFT.  IMPRESSION: The findings of these tests point to an extense, complete lesion of the Parietal cortical areas on both  hemispheres with partial preservation of the convexity of the LEFT hemisphere, with compromised electrophysiological brainstem function. These problems could be compatible with lesions from an ischemic/anoxic encephalopathy. These finding in presence of only one and abnormal N20 waveform from the Median nerve SSEPs give this patient a bad neu- rological outcome prognosis, and, an uncertain survival one.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 11.0  and 8.8 ms, at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: A noisy positive-negative-positive-negative complex was recording with latencies for the N20 and  P30 waveforms of 19.7 and 22.2 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 11.3  and 7.5 ms, at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Noisy Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves with morphology, peak  latencies, amplitude and L/R differences within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: No cortical respones could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 33.3 and  9.0 ms, at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD:  No cortical respones could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 32.3 and  10.7 ms, at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Noisy Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for absence  of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervicals and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathways at the level of or above, the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely  at the cortical level on both hemispheres.  BAEPs: AS:  Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.7, 3.7 and 7.1 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.7, 4.3 and 6.4 ms respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with appropriate morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of wave V on the Left side, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals III-V, and I-V also on the Left side, suggestive of lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level  of the Upper Pons/Lower Midbrain on the the LEFT side. The BAEP elicited when the Right ear is stimu- lated is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies point to a bilateral, partial lesion or the Parietal cortex at the para-median  areas of both hemispheres with a partial compromise of the electrographic brainstem function, that could be caused by a hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Median Nerve stimulation:  Technique:   Stimulation of left ulnar (US) and right ulnar (UD) nerves was performed simultaneously with stimulating electrodes positioned at the wrist, 1 cm apart (US, UD), with the positive electrode proximal to the negative electrode.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used.  Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.  Recording electrodes were positioned as follows:  Ch 1) right parietal cortex to frontal midline (P4/Fz); Ch 2) left parietal cortex to frontal midline (P3/Fz); Ch 2) mastoid to frontal midline (M/Fz); and Ch 4) left erb's point to right erb's point (EpS/EpD). Amplifier bandpass was 10 to 1000 Hz for Ch 1 and Ch 2; 100 to 1000 Hz for Ch 3 and Ch 4.  The patient reclined in the supine position, in a dimly lit room, with eyes gently closed.  Results:          Left Ulnar Nerve Stimulation (US): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 11.7 ms. Evoked responses were not recorded at the cervical spine, subcortically, or at the right parietal cortex. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left ulnar nerve are absent above the level of the left brachial plexus, suggestive of a diffuse brain injury.   Right Ulnar Nerve Stimulation (UD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 11.2 ms. Evoked responses were not recorded at the cervical spine, subcortically, or at the left parietal cortex. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right ulnar nerve are absent above the level of the right brachial plexus, suggestive of a diffuse brain injury.    2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Technique:   Stimulation of left (TS) and right (TD) tibial nerves was performed simultaneously, with stimulation electrodes positioned at the medial malleolous, with the positive electrode proximal.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used. Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms. Recording electrodes were positioned as follows:  Ch 1) midline parietal cortex to frontal midline (Pz/Fz); Ch 2) mastoid  to frontal midline (M/Fz); Ch 3) popliteal fossa (PF+/PF-). Amplifier bandpass was 10 to 1000 Hz for Ch 1, and 100 to 1000 Hz for Ch 2 and Ch 3.  The patient reclined in a supine position, in a dimly lit room, with eyes gently closed.  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): Evoked responses were not recorded at the cervical spine, subcortically, or at the right parietal cortex. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are absent above the level of the left lumbar plexus, suggestive of a diffuse brain injury.   Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): Evoked responses were not recorded at the cervical spine, subcortically, or at the left parietal cortex. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are absent above the level of the right lumbar plexus, suggestive of a diffuse brain injury.    3. Impression:         The recording of brachial plexus SSEPs from US and UD and the visible evoked motor twitching in intrinsic hand muscles, bilaterally, confirmed adequate peripheral nerve stimulation was achieved. The absence of SSEPs at the level of the brainstem and cerebral cortex, bilaterally, suggests an extensive and diffuse brain injury.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 15.3 and 10.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recor- ded at 13.7 and 11.0 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential elicited from the Right Median nerve ABNORMAL for total abscense of cortical responses, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal column nucleus, most likely at the  cortical level of the LEFT hemisphere. The SEP elicited from the Left Median nerve is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 31.8 and 7.7 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 30.3 and 8.8 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from the Tibial nerves ABNORMAL  for complete abscense of cortical responses, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway, at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level of BOTH hemispheres.  BAEPs: AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.7, 5.4 and 6.8  ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.3, 3.6 and 5.7  ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential elicited from the Left ear with appro- priate morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of all waves beyond wave I on  the Left side, and prolonged inter-peak intervals I-III and I-V also in the Left side, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the Upper Medulla/Lower Pons on the LEFT side. The BAEP elicited from the Right ear is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: The studies point to extended, multiple lesions of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres, mainly at the para-median areas, but also at the convexity on the Right side, as  well as, to a unilateral compromise of the electrophysiological brainstem function. The findings  are compatible with those produced by an ischemic/hypoxic encephalopathy.

INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves with morphology, latencies, amplitude and  L/R differences within NORMAL limits for the age range.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordingsL Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.2, 4.3 and 6.1 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordingsL Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.7, 4.6 and 6.7 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential elicited from the RIGHTear with appropriate morphology,  but ABNORMAL for all delayed peak latencies, with preserved amplitude and inter-peak intervals, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the acoustic media in the external auditory cannal or at the peripheral nerve. The BAEP elicited when the LEFT ear was stimulated is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies point to a possible lesion of VIIIth Cranial nerve (or its acoustic media preceding it) on the RIGHT side which could be of a wide variety of causes. The bilateral presence of the N20 waveform on the cortical responses from the Median nerve SSEPs of this patient, give him a good neurological outcome and survival prognoses.",,,,,,Yes,6/3/14

I remotely supervised the testing, but personally reviewed the information recorded and available and this is my impression:  SSEPs:  MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.8 and 8.8 ms at the  cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.7 and 9.7 ms at the  cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of   cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the  neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on BOTH hemis- pheres.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.7 and 8.7 ms at the  cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.7 and 9.0 ms at the  cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of   cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the  neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on BOTH hemis- pheres.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.7, 5.1 and 7.9 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.0, 6.8 and 8.8 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION:  Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential with acceptable morphology, but ABNORMAL for delayed  peak latencies of waves III and V on both sides, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals III-V and I-V, also on both  sides, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Medulla/lower Pons on  the BOTH sides, with the RIGHT being the worst.   IMPRESSION: These studies point to extensive, complete lesions of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres, with  compromised electrophysiological brainstem function, that could be the result of a hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.  The bilateral absence of the N20 cortical response from this patient's Median nerve SEPs give  him a bad neurologic  outcome and survival prognoses.

I remotely supervised the testing, but personally reviewed the  information recorded and available. Unfortunately the patient is not relaxed, therefore the signals were ex- tremy noisy, but this is my impression:  SSEPs:  MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.5 and 9.0 ms  at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 13.8 and 9.0 ms  at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete abscense  of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compres- sion of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal column nuclei, most likely at the cortical level of BOTH hemispheres.   TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 33.0 and 8.3 ms  at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively.

I remotely supervised the testing but personally reviewed all the information recorded and available and this is my  impression:  SSEPs:  MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 16.0 and  10.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 15.3 and 11.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete  absence of cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion  or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the  cortical level on BOTH hemispheres.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.3 and  6.3 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 26.7 and 6.7 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials of Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of  cortical responses, with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression  of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on  BOTH hemispheres.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.5, 4.8 and 6.8 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.5, 4.9 and 6.8 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION:  Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials ABNORMAL for delayed peak latencies of waves III  and V on both sides, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals I-III, and I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of a le- sion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Medulla/lower Pons on the BOTH sides.  IMPRESSION: These studies point to extensive, complete lesions of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres, with  compromised electrophysiological brainstem function, that could be the result of a hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.  The bilateral absence of the N20 cortical response from this patient's Median nerve SEPs give  him a bad neurological  outcome and survival prognoses.

who apparently suffered a cardiac arrest and received CPR for approximately 40 minutes before coming to Hospital. I remotely supervised the testing, but personally reviewed the information recorded and available and this is my impression:  SSEPs:  MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 12.5 and 9.8 ms, at the  cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 12.8 and 10.3 ms, at the  cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory evoked potentials from Median nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical res- ponses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both hemispheres.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 30.7 and 10.7 ms, at the  cervical and Popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 29.5 and 11.5 ms, at the  cervical and Popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory evoked potentials from Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical res- ponses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on both hemispheres.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.4, 4.9 and 8.4 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.4, 4.8 and 8.0 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with acceptable morphology but ABNORMAL for de- layed peak latencies of all waves beyond wave I on both sides, as well as, prolonged inter-peak intervals I-III, and  I-V, also on both sides, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the auditory pathway at the level of the upper Me- dulla/lower Pons on both sides, but worse on the Left.  IMPRESSION: The findings of these studies point to a complete, bilateral lesion of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres, with compromised electrographic brainstem function. These findings could be the ones found after  a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

I personally supervised the testing and reviewed the informa tion recorded and available and this is my impression:  Pt was not hypothermic but at the moment under hemo-dyalisis, Propofol at 50 mcg/hr, EEG shows burst- supression pattern. The pateint is a known diabetic with neuropathy. After several attemps, we were not able to collect anything different than electryc noise from the SSEPs.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.3, 5.2 and 8.3 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.6, 4.4 and 7.2 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with poor but acceptable morpholgy, ABNORMAL for de- layed peak latencies of waves III and V on the left side, while only wave V at the right, and with prolonged inter- peak intervals I-III, III-V, and I-V on the left side while III-V and I-V on the right side suggestive of a lesion or  compression of the auditory pathways at the level of the upper Medulla/lower Pons on the LEFT side while at the upper Pons/lower Midbrain on the RIGHT one.    IMPRESSION: This data point to a bilateral compromise of the brainstem electrophysiological function. Although, it was impossible to collect any useful data from the SSEPs and therefore we can not try to infere a prognosis from  that data, I think this patient's neurological outcome's prognosis can not be good with a bilateral lesion of his brainstem.

INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential from Median nerves ABNORMAL for absence  of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or  compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal column nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on the BOTH hemispheres.

MS: No cortical responses could be indentified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 12.3 and 8.3 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be indentified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 11.5 and 8.0 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Median nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical res- ponses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on BOTH hemispheres.  TS: No cortical responses could be indentified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 24.2 and 6.5 ms at the cervical and Popliteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be indentified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 24.3 and 6.5 ms at the cervical and Popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for absence of cortical res- ponses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level, on BOTH hemispheres.

AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.3, 4.6 and 6.4 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals, L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.  IMPRESSION: These studies point to a bilateral, total, complete lesion of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres with preserved brainstem electrophysiological function.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.3 and 10.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. MD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.5 and 10.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Median nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of cor- tical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neu- ral pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on BOTH hemispheres.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 29.0 and 7.8 ms at the cervical and Poplteal points, respectively. TD: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 28.7 and 9.0 ms at the cervical and Popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potentials from Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of cor- tical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved, suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neu- ral pathway at the level of, or above the dorsal columns nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on BOTH hemispheres.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.2, 4.5, and 6.1 ms, respectively. AD: Right ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 2.1, 4.4, and 6.2 ms, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals,  L/R differences and ratios, within NORMAL limits.  IMPRESSION: These studies point to complete, total lesion of the Parietal cortex from both hemispheres with pre- served electrographic brainstem function. These findings can be seen as result of an hypoxic/ischemic encephalo- pathy.

A veryu small NP response complex was recorded at the right parietal cortex with peak latencies of 25.3 ms and 34.0 ms (N20/P30), respectively.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are present and delayed at the level of the inferior brainstem, above which, nominal responses were recorded, suggesting a lesion or compression at the level of the brainstem on the left side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 10.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 16.3 ms. An NP response complex was recorded at the left parietal cortex with peak latencies of 24.7 ms and 32.7 ms (N20/P30), respectively. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are moderately abnormal at the level of the right brainstem.    2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 14.0 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 37.3 ms. A nominal positive peak (P40) was recorded over midline parietal cortex at a peak latency of 54.5 ms. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed with only nominal cortical responses recorded, suggestive of a lesion and/or compression at the level of the brainstem, or above, on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 16.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 28.3 ms. An negative peak (N37) was recorded at the left parietal cortex with peak latency of 50.3 ms.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed with only nominal cortical responses recorded, suggestive of a lesion and/or compression at the level of the brainstem, or above, on the left side.  3.

Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology but are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side. Right Auditory Stimulation (AD): Waves I, II, III and a Wave IV/V response complex were recorded at peak latencies of 2.1, 3.2, 4.5 and 7.0 ms, respectively. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good morphology but are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.    4.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.3 and 9.7 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.             MS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 14.7 and 9.5 ms at the cervical and Erb's points, respectively.                                                                                     INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential from the Left Median nerve ABNORMAL for complete absence of cortical responses with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the  level of, or above the dorsal column nucleus, most likely at the cortical level on the RIGHT hemisphere. The SEP elicited when the  Right Median nerve was stimulated is within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified.

INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential from Tibial nerves ABNORMAL for complete absence of cortical responses  with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of, or  above the dorsal column nuclei, most likely at the cortical level on BOTH hemispheres.

was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 23.5  and 34.5 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 15.8 and 10.8 ms at the cervical and Erb's points,  respectively.                                                                                                                        MD: A cortical negative-positive-negative-positive complex was recorded with latencies for the N20 and P30 waveforms of 25.3  and 35.7 ms, respectively. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 17.3 and 11.2 ms at the cervical and Erb's points,  respectively.                                                                                     INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential from the Right Median nerve ABNORMAL for delayed cortical responses  with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of,  or above the dorsal column nucleus on the LEFT hemisphere. The SEP elicited when the Left Median nerve was stimulated is  within NORMAL limits for the age range.  TS: No cortical responses could be identified. Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.3 and 6.7 ms at the cervical and  popliteal points, respectively.

Sub-cortical negative waves were recorded at 27.5 and 7.2 ms at the cervical and popliteal points, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Somatosensory Evoked Potential from the Left Tibial nerve ABNORMAL for absence of cortical responses  with sub-cortical cervical and peripherals preserved suggestive of a lesion or compression of the neural pathway at the level of,  or above the dorsal column nucleus on the RIGHT hemisphere. The SEP elicited when the Right Tibial nerve was stimulated is  within NORMAL limits for the age range.  BAEPs:  AS: Left ear recordings: Waves I, III and V were identified at peak latencies of 1.9, 4.0 and 6.1 ms, respectively.

INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals, L/R differences  and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.                                                                                        IMPRESSION: The results of these studies point to a partial damage of the Parietal cortex on the Left hemisphere at the  convexity areas and of cortical and/or sub-cortical areas above of the brainstem of the Right one, with preserved electrographic  brain-stem function. These patchy cortico/subcortical lessions could be the result of a hypoxic-ischemic or other encephalopathies. The bilateral presence of the N20 waveforms from the cortical responses of this patient's Median nerve SSEPs make its  neurological outcome and survival prognoses good.",Yes,9/9/15

INTERPRETATION: Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials with morphology, peak latencies, inter-peak intervals,  L/R differences and ratios within NORMAL limits for the age range.                                                                                        IMPRESSION: The results of these studies point to bilateral damage of the Parietal cortex on both hemispheres at the para- sagittal areas and at the convexity of the Right one, with preserved electrographic brain-stem function. The presence/absence of  one of the N20 waveforms from the cortical responses of this patient's Median nerve SSEPs make its neurological outcome and  survival prognoses uncertain.",No,,,,,Yes,12/4/15

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from Right Median Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of the left (MS)  and right (MD) median nerves was performed with stimulating electrodes positioned at the wrist, 1 cm apart with the positive electrode proximal to the negative electrode.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used.  Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.    Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 9.5 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.2 ms.  The SSEP at the right parietal cortex was not recorded.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are abnormal/absent at or above the level of the upper brainstem on the right side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 9.8 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.2 ms.  An SSEP was not recorded at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are abnormal/absent at or above the level of the upper brainstem on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of left (TS) and right (TD) tibial nerves was performed simultaneously, with stimulation electrodes positioned at the medial malleolous, with the positive electrode proximal.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used. Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 10.7 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was not recorded.  An SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are absent at and above the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 9.3 ms but was not recorded at the cervical spine.   An SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve absent at and above the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   The right (AD) and left (AS) ears were stimulated independently, using alternating rarefractive and condensative clicks with at least an 95 dbSPL intensity level. A uniform stimulus rate of 17.5 Hz was used. White noise was applied to the contralateral ear at 70 dbSPL. The observation interval was 15 ms. One thousand and twenty four responses were averaged for each epoch.   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Waves I,II,  III were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 3.7 and 5.6 ms, respectively. Waves IV and V were not recorded  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed at the level of the Pons on the left side and are absent at and above the level of the Pons on the right side.   Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 3.4, 4.5, 5.8 and 7.6 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed at the level of the Pons on the right side.      4. Impression:          Cortical SSEPs from MS, MD, TS, TD are absent and BSERs from AS and AD are absent and/or abnormal, respectively, at and above the level of the Pons.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from Right Median Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of the left (MS)  and right (MD) median nerves was performed with stimulating electrodes positioned at the wrist, 1 cm apart with the positive electrode proximal to the negative electrode.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used.  Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.    Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 11.0 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.8 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded at the right parietal cortex with peak latencies of 22.5 ms and 27.6 ms (N20/P30), respectively.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.0 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded at the left parietal cortex with peak latencies of 24.0 ms and 29.7 ms (N20/P30), respectively.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are are within normal limits.      2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of left (TS) and right (TD) tibial nerves was performed simultaneously, with stimulation electrodes positioned at the medial malleolous, with the positive electrode proximal.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used. Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.8 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 31.2 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 43.0 ms and 49.3 ms, respectively  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression above the inferior brainstem on the right side.   Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.8 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 32.3 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 41.0 ms and 48.5 ms, respectively  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression above the inferior brainstem on the left side.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   The right (AD) and left (AS) ears were stimulated independently, using alternating rarefractive and condensative clicks with at least an 95 dbSPL intensity level. A uniform stimulus rate of 17.5 Hz was used. White noise was applied to the contralateral ear at 70 dbSPL. The observation interval was 15 ms. One thousand and twenty four responses were averaged for each epoch.   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.0, 3.5, 4.8, 6.3 and 7.3 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the Pons on the left side.   Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I,II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.4, 3.8, 5.0, 6.9 and 8.1 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the Pons on the right side.     4. Impression:          Cortical SSEPs from TS and TD are abnormal and BSERs from AS and AD are very abnormal at and above the level of the Pons. These data support bilateral, possibly diffuse injuries and/or compressions predominantly at the level of the superior brainstem bilaterally and possibly to a less extent involving the mesial parietal lobes, bilaterally.",No,,,,,No,,,ACS,,No,,No,,1/6/17,"Rearrested, intractable shock, multisystem organ failure",6,6,,,,,,Yes,No,01062017-025,No potential as a donor,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-006,53,Female,1/8/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,PEA,IV,Yes,No,Heritage Valley Hospital (Medical Center of Beaver County),,DBA Medic Rescue,,,,STAT MedEvac,,,,1/8/17 0:40,Asystole,Lay person witnessed,Lay person,No,0,20,20,3,0,New supraglottic airway,Yes,0,1475,[document],,,43912219,[document],1/8/17 3:39,2D/SICU (Surgical ICU),,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unable to determine,No response to pain,Both nonreactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",36C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,1/8/17 6:03,0.93,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,No,,,,,No,,,Toxicological,,No,,No,,1/10/17,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,2,2,,,,,,Yes,No,01082017-030,No potential as a donor,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-007,76,Male,1/6/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,Asystole,IV,No,,,,Rostraver/West Newton,,STAT MedEvac,,,,,,1/6/17 9:41,Asystole,Lay person witnessed,Lay person,No,4,50,50,5,0,New endotracheal intubation,Yes,1,43887550,[document],43888626,[document],,,1/6/17 11:16,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unable to determine,No response to pain,Both nonreactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, breathing with the vent",33C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,1/6/17 12:32,1.31,No,No,Yes,1/6/17 15:07,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,No,,,,,No,,,ACS,,No,,No,,1/6/17,"Rearrested, intractable shock, multisystem organ failure",0,0,,,,,,Yes,No,01062017-049,No potential as a donor,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-008,87,Male,1/6/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,VT/VF,III,Yes,No,UPMC -

Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.    Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.2 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.0 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the right parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.3 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent left cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of left (TS) and right (TD) tibial nerves was performed simultaneously, with stimulation electrodes positioned at the medial malleolous, with the positive electrode proximal.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used. Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied). The observation interval was 100 ms.   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 7.8 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 31.7 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 7.2 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 31.5 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent left cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the left side.    3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   The right (AD) and left (AS) ears were stimulated independently, using alternating rarefractive and condensative clicks with at least an 95 dbSPL intensity level. A uniform stimulus rate of 17.5 Hz was used. White noise was applied to the contralateral ear at 70 dbSPL. The observation interval was 15 ms. One thousand and twenty four responses were averaged for each epoch.   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Wave I alone was recorded at a peak latency of 2.6 ms.   Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are abnormally delayed at the level of the auditory nerve (Wave I). Subsequent BSER Waves were not recorded and were absent, suggestive of a significant or complete lesion or compression of the brainstem at the level of the cochlear nucleus on the left side.  Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I,II, III and a Wave  IV/V response complex, were recorded at peak latencies of 2.0, 3.1, 4.4 and 7.1 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed (Wave III), suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the crossed auditory pathway at the superior olivary nucleus on the left side.    4. Impression:          The absent cortical SSEPs x4 are indicative of a complete block of somatosensory transmission, bilaterally, above the level of the medulla that could involve superior brainstem and/or cerebral structures.  The almost complete loss of the BSER from AS together with the abnormal crossed BSER from AD, support the level of a lesion to be at the Pons on the left side. The absent right cortical SSEPs further suggests a diffuse but major lesion of the right superior brainstem above the Pons and/or within the right cerebral hemisphere.",No,,,,,No,,,Toxicological,,No,,No,,2/7/17,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,11,11,,,,,,Yes,No,01272017-070,Attempted donation and aborted,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-023,53,Male,1/17/17,In-hospital cardiac arrest,Other,,PEA,Unknown,Yes,Yes,UPMC -

Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are abnormally delayed at the level of the brachial plexus and are further delayed at the level of the medulla and right parietal lobe, suggestive of a combination of peripheral neuropathy and/or compression at the level of the brainstem on the left side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 13.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 17.5 ms.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from Right Median Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of the left (MS)  and right (MD) median nerves was performed with stimulating electrodes positioned at the wrist, 1 cm apart with the positive electrode proximal to the negative electrode.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used.  Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied).  The observation interval was 100 ms.    Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.2 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.0 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the right parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 8.2 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 11.8 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent left cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Technique:    Stimulation of left (TS) and right (TD) tibial nerves was performed simultaneously, with stimulation electrodes positioned at the medial malleolous, with the positive electrode proximal.  A uniform stimulus rate of  2.35Hz was used. Two hundred and fifty six responses were averaged for each epoch.  Two epochs were obtained for each stimulus condition, including controls (no stimulus applied). The observation interval was 100 ms.   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.2 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 34.2 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 8.2 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 33.3 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent left cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the left side.    3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   The right (AD) and left (AS) ears were stimulated independently, using alternating rarefractive and condensative clicks with at least an 95 dbSPL intensity level. A uniform stimulus rate of 17.5 Hz was used. White noise was applied to the contralateral ear at 70 dbSPL. The observation interval was 15 ms. One thousand and twenty four responses were averaged for each epoch.   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Waves I, II, III and IV were recorded at peak latencies of 2.5, 3.3, 4.7 and 6.8 ms. Wave V was not recorded and was absent.   Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are abnormally delayed at the level of the auditory nerve (Wave I) and subsequent BSER Waves are further delayed and absent, suggestive of multiple sites of lesions or compressions of the brainstem at the level of the cochlear nucleus on the left side and lateral lemniscal pathway on the right side.   Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II and III were recorded at peak latencies of 2.4, 3.6 and 6.4 ms, respectively. Waves IV and V were not recorded and were absent  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor and abnormal morphology and are very delayed (Wave III), suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the crossed auditory pathway at the superior olivary nucleus on the left side.    4. Impression:          The absent cortical SSEPs x4 are indicative of a complete block of somatosensory transmission, bilaterally, above the level of the medulla that could involve superior brainstem and/or cerebral structures.  The abnormal and asymmetric mid-latency BSERs and absent later BSER Waves from AS and AD support bilateral lesions at the level of the Pons and further complete lesions at the level of the midbrain, bilaterally.",No,,,,,No,,,Respiratory,,No,,No,,2/26/17,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,4,4,,,,,,Yes,No,02232017-015,No potential as a donor,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-047,89,Male,2/24/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,PEA,II,No,,,,Mon Valley EMS,,STAT MedEvac,,,,,,2/24/17 21:37,PEA,EMS witnessed,Professional,No,0,3,3,1,0,Other,Yes,0,44618129,[document],44619110,[document],,,2/24/17 21:45,4F5F (Neuro ICU/NICU),,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Eyelids closed with pain,No response to pain,Both reactive,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,Unable to determine,"Intubated, breathing with the vent",36C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,No,,,,,Yes,2/26/17 15:58,,Unknown,Seizure vs resp vs tox,Yes,2/28/17,Yes,2/24/17,,,7,26,,Skilled nursing facility,,3,5,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-048,58,Male,2/25/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,PEA,I,Yes,No,UPMC -

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from Right Median Nerve stimulation:   Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 15.7 ms.  The SSEP at the right parietal cortex was not recorded.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are absent above the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 11.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 16.3 ms.  An SSEP was not recorded at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are absent above the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 13.7 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at 37.0 ms.  An SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are absent above the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 13.0 ms and at the cervical spine at 35.3 ms.

Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are absent above the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Waves I,II, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 4.3, 5.1 and 6.4 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology and are within normal limits.    Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 3.6, 4.5, 5.1 and 6.4 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good morphology and are within normal limits.      4. Impression:          Cortical SSEPs from MS, MD, TS, TD are absent (x4) and subcortical SSEPs and BSERs from AS and AD are normal at the level of the inferior and middle brainstem.

The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the right parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 12.7 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent left cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 7.3 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 34.0 ms.  The NP response complex was not recorded and was absent over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla, above which the absent right cortical SSEP is suggestive of a complete injury of the somatosensory pathways above the level of the medulla on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 8.0 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at a peak latency of 31.0 ms.  A very poor NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 49.0 ms and 60.0 ms, respectively.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the ipsilateral medulla and are abnormal at the level of the left parietal lobe, suggestive of a major lesion and/or compression at the level of the upper brainstem and/or mesial parietal cortex, on the left side.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):  Waves I, II and III were recorded at peak latencies of 2.4, 3.8 and 5.9 ms, respectively. Waves IV and V were not recorded and were absent.   Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are abnormally delayed at the level of Wave III and subsequent BSER Waves are absent, suggestive of a significant lesion or compressions of the brainstem at the level of the superior olive nucleus on the right side.    Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I and II were recorded at peak latencies of 2.4 and 4.0 ms, respectively. Waves III, IV and V were not recorded and were absent  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor and abnormal morphology and are delayed at Wave II, suggestive of a significant lesion or compression at the level of the auditory pathway at the cochlear nucleus on the right side and crossed level of the superior olive nucleus on the left side.      4. Impression:          The absent cortical SSEPs x3 and very poor cortical SSEPs x1 are indicative of a complete and near complete block of somatosensory transmission, bilaterally, above the level of the medulla that could involve superior brainstem and/or cerebral structures.  The abnormal and asymmetric mid-latency BSERs and absent later BSER Waves from AS and AD support bilateral lesions at the level of the Pons and further complete lesions at the level of the midbrain, bilaterally.",,,,,,No,,,Unknown,Airway obstruction vs tox,No,,No,,4/27/17,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,7,7,,,,,,Yes,Yes,04212017-007,,Controlled DCD,Checked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-105,73,Male,4/23/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,Asystole,II,Yes,No,Uniontown Hospital,,Fayette EMS,,,,STAT MedEvac,,,,4/23/17 12:32,PEA,EMS witnessed,No,No,0,20,20,3,0,New endotracheal intubation,Yes,0,45455592,[document],,,45452734,[document],4/23/17 15:20,3F (CCU),,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unable to determine,Flexion response to pain,Both nonreactive,Both present,Absent,Present,Unable to determine,36C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,4/23/17 18:11,1.31,No,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,No,,,Airway obstruction,,Yes,4/27/17,No,,5/2/17,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,5,9,,,,,,Yes,No,04242017-018,No potential as a donor,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2017-106,59,Male,4/26/17,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,VT/VF,IV,Yes,No,Uniontown Hospital,,EMS Southwest,,,,STAT MedEvac,,,,4/25/17 22:10,Asystole,Lay person witnessed,Lay person,No,2,49,35,7,0,New endotracheal intubation,Yes,0,45523621,[document],,,45490258,[document],4/26/17 1:18,3F (CCU),,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Eyelids closed with pain,No response to pain,Both reactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",36C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,4/26/17 4:05,1.35,No,No,Yes,4/26/17 2:48,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,5/1/17 13:27,Bilaterally present N20,"Bedside somatosensory evoked potentials in response to bilateral median and tibial nerve stimulation were recorded.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Median Nerve stimulation:   Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 15.0 ms.  An NP response complex wasnot recorded at the right parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are normal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the right side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 11.0 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.7 ms.  An NP response complex was not recorded at the left parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are normal at  the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 15.0 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at 33.7 ms.   The cortical SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are normal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the right side.   Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 14.7 ms and at the cervical spine at 33.7 ms.   The cortical SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are normal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the left side.     3.

Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology but are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side.    Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II, III and a IV/V response complex were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 3.7, 4.8 and 6.7 ms, respectively  Interpretation:       The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good morphology but are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.    4. Impression:          Cortical SSEPs are absent x4 limb SSEPs. Subcortical brainstem SSEPs x4 are normal. The BSERs from AS and AD are abnormal at the level of the superior brainstem.

An NP response complex was not recorded at the right parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are normal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the right side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 12.0 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 16.3 ms.  An NP response complex was not recorded at the left parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are normal at  the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the superior brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the left side.     2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 14.3 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at 38.3 ms.   The cortical SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are abnormal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of significant lesions at the level of the left side brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the right side.   Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.3 ms and at the cervical spine at 36.3 ms.   The cortical SSEP was not recorded over midline parietal cortex.  Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are abnormal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of significant lesions at the level of the right side brainstem and/or cerebral cortex on the left side.     3.

Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are barely discernible and of extremely poor morphology and are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side.    Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 1.9, 3.2, 4.9, 7.1 and 7.9 ms, respectively  Interpretation:       The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.    4.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral  Median Nerve stimulation:   Results:      Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 12.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 16.0 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded at the right parietal cortex with peak latencies of 22.7 ms and 27.0 ms (N20/P30), respectively.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):  An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 12.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 16.3 ms.  An NP response complex was recorded at the left parietal cortex with peak latencies of 22.3 ms and 27.3 ms (N20/P30), respectively.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits.      2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:   Results:           Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.7 ms. A barely discernible subcortical SSEP was recorded at 37.0 ms.    The NP cortical SSEP responses were not recorded over midline parietal cortex.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are of good morphology and within normal limits up to the level of the inferior brainstem above which the absence of cortical responses is suggestive of a significant lesion or compressions at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal cortex on the right side.     Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):  An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 11.0 ms. A barely discernible subcortical SSEP was recorded at 40.3 ms.  A very poor NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 50.0 ms and 65.5 ms, respectively.   Interpretation:          The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal cortex on the left side.       3.

Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology but are slightly delayed, suggestive of a minor lesion or compression at the level of the superior Brainstem on the right side.   Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):  Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.2, 3.3, 4.3, 5.6 and 6.4 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:          The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good  morphology and are slightly delayed, suggestive of a minor lesion or compression at the level of the superior  Brainstem on the left side.     4. Impression:          Cortical SSEPs from MS MD are unremarkable and are absent and very abnormal from TS and TD, respectively, likely secondary to the abnormal Lower extremity Subcortical SSEPs x2.

Interpretation:     The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are within normal limits for age 87. 4. Impression:        Subcortical brainstem SSEPs are normal x4 at the level of the inferior brainstem and the BSERs from AS and AD are also normal x2 at the level of the superior brainstem. However, Cortical SSEPs are absent x4 limb SSEPs.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral  Median Nerve stimulation:  Results:     Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 11.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 15.7 ms. A Negative N20 response was recorded at the right parietal cortex with a peak latency of 37.3 ms while the subsequent P30 cortical SSEP was recorded at 45.3 ms.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the left inferior brainstem, above which the cortical SSEPs are very delayed, suggestive of a major injury or compression of the somatosensory pathway at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the right side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 11.0 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.7 ms. Very small amplitude and delayed cortical SSEPs were  recorded at the left  parietal cortex with peak latencies of 40.7 and 49.3 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the right inferior brainstem above which, the cortical SSEPs are  abnormally delayed, suggestive of a major lesion and/or compression at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the left side.    2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 8.3 ms. A subcortical SSEP was recorded at 32.0 ms.   An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 47.0 ms and 66.8 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compressions above the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and/or at the level of the right parietal cortex.    Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 9.7 ms. A subcortical SSEP was recorded at 33.0 ms.   An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 40.3 ms and 48.0 ms, resepectively.   Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compressions above the inferior brainstem on the left side and/or at the level of the left parietal cortex.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS): Waves I, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of  2.1, 4.6, 5.8 and 6.7 ms, respectively. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side.  Right Auditory Stimulation (AD): Waves I, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.1, 4.4, 6.9 and 7.7 ms, respectively. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good  morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.   4. Impression:         Cortical SSEPs from MS, MD, PS and PD are all abnormal while subcortical SSEPs generated at the inferior brainstem from all four limbs are normal. AS and AD are abnormal at the level of the superior brainstem, bilaterally. This pattern is suggestive of diffuse injuries and/or lesions at the level of the superior brainstem, bilaterally and further diffuse injuries/lesions at the level of the parietal cortex, bilaterally.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral  Median Nerve stimulation: Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS):An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 9.8 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.8 ms.Abnormally small amplitude N20 and P30 responses were recorded at the right parietal cortex with peak latencies of 21.8 ms and 26.0 ms. Interpretation:        The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal latency limits with abnormally low amplitude, suggestive of an injury or compression of the somatosensory pathway at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the right side.   Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD):An evoked potential was recorded at Erb_s point at 10.5 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.3 ms.Abnormally small amplitude N20 and P30 responses were recorded at the left parietal cortex with peak latencies of 21.7 ms and 27.2 ms. Interpretation:        The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal latency limits with abnormally low amplitude, suggestive of a lesion and/or compression at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the left side.  2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation: Results:         Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS):An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 9.3 ms. A subcortical SSEP was recorded at 31.7 ms.  An abnormally low amplitude cortical SSEP was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 37.8 ms and 43.0 ms, respectively. Interpretation:        The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and abnormally small amplitude, suggestive of a lesion or compressions at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the right side.   Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD):An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 13.8 ms. A subcortical SSEP was recorded at 30.8 ms.  An abnormally low amplitude cortical SSEP was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 36.8 ms and 43.7 ms, respectively. Interpretation:        The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are of poor morphology and abnormally small amplitude, suggestive of a lesion or compressions at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the left side.   3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:  Left Auditory Stimulation (AS):This was a non-diagnostic study _ Wave I of the BSER was not recorded, suggestive of an occlusion of the ear canal or an injury to the tympanic membrane.Right Auditory Stimulation (AD):This was a non-diagnostic study _ Wave I of the BSER was not reliable, suggestive of an occlusion of the ear canal or an injury to the tympanic membrane4. Impression:        Cortical SSEPs from MS, MD, TS and TD are all abnormal and the subcortical SSEPs x4 are all normal at the level of the inferior brainstem, bilaterally.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral  Median Nerve stimulation:  Results:     Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 12.3 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 15.7 ms. ANegative N20 response was recorded at the right parietal cortex with a peak latency of 23.7 ms while the subsequent P30 cortical SSEP was 0t recorded.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within 0rmal limits up to the level of the right parietal cortex at which the primary cortical SSEP (P30) was absent, suggestive of a right cortical level injury or lesion.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 13.0 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 18.3 ms. ANegative N20 response was recorded at the left parietal cortex with a peak latency of 25.7 ms while the subsequent P30 cortical SSEP was 0t recorded.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are ab0rmally delayed, suggestive of multiple diffuse injuries at the level of the of the right inferior brainstem and the left  parietal cortex.   2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 10.0 ms. The subcortical SSEP was recorded at 34.7 ms.   An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 41.7 ms and 46.3 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are of good morphology but are ab0rmally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compressions above the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side.    Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 12.0 ms. The subcortical SSEP was recorded at 36.3 ms. An NP response complex was recorded over midline parietal cortex at peak latencies of 42.3 ms and 47.3 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are of good morphology but are ab0rmally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compressions at both the right inferior brainstem and subsequently at the level of the left parietal cortex.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS): Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of  2.6, 3.7, 4.8, 6.1 and 6.9 ms, respectively. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of good morphology and are ab0rmally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side.  Right Auditory Stimulation (AD): Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.4, 3.9, 4.7, 5.8 and 6.7 ms, respectively. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of good  morphology and are ab0rmally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.   4. Impression:         Cortical SSEPs from MS and MD are absent and from TS and TD are ab0rmal. Subcortical SSEPs from MD and TD at the right inferior brainstem are ab0rmal and the BSERs from AS and AD are also ab0rmal at the level of the superior brainstem, bilaterally. This pattern is suggestive of asymmetric (R > L), bilateral injuries and/or lesions at the level of the inferior brainstem, further diffuse injuries/lesions at the level of the superior brainstem, bilaterally and further diffuse injuries/lesions at the level of the parietal cortex, bilaterally.",,,,,,Yes,2/24/18 16:45,,Exsanguination,,No,,Yes,3/9/18,,,17,17,No,Long-term acute

(Verified) 1. Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Median Nerve stimulation:  Results:     Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 9.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.3 ms. The Cortical SSEP response complex was not recorded at the right parietal cortex.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are normal up to the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and are absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the somatosensory cortex on the right side.  Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 9.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 13.0 ms. The Cortical SSEP response complex was not recorded at the left parietal cortex.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are normal up to the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and are absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the somatosensory cortex on the left side.   2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 10.7 ms. The evoked potential at the cervical spine was recorded at 27.3 ms.  The cortical SSEP response complex was not recorded at the right parietal cortex.  Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left posterior tibial nerve are normal up to the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and are absent at the right parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the somatosensory cortex on the right side.  Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 17.7 ms and at the cervical spine at 28.7 ms.  The cortical SSEP response complex was not recorded at the left parietal cortex. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right posterior tibial nerve are normal at the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and are absent at the left parietal cortex, suggestive of a significant lesion at the level of the somatosensory cortex on the left side.   3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:  Left Auditory Stimulation (AS): Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.1, 3.3, 4.2, 5.6 and 6.6 ms, respectively.   Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are within normal limits for age.  Right Auditory Stimulation (AD): Waves I, II, III, IV and V were recorded at peak latencies of 2.0, 3.3, 4.3, 5.7 and 7.1 ms, respectively.  Interpretation:      The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor  morphology and are abnormally delayed, suggestive of a lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.   4. Impression:         Subcortical brainstem SSEPs and the BSER from AS are normal x5 at the level of the bilateral inferior and right side superior brainstem. The BSER from AD is abnormal at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side. Cortical SSEPs are absent x4 limb SSEPs. These data support an incomplete injury at the level of the unilateral left superior brainstem with further bilateral and severe / complete injuries at the supratentorial level of the thalamus and/or parietal lobes, bilaterally.",No,,,,,No,,,Respiratory,,No,,No,,3/21/18,Withdrawal for perceived poor neurological prognosis,5,5,No,,,,,Yes,No,03172018-007,Patient or family refusal,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2018-166,68,Male,3/18/18,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,No loss of pulse,I,Yes,No,UPMC - East,,Murrysville Medic One,"Mr. Thomas Brungo, Mr. William Spangler, Ms. Emily Coffen & Ms. Loretta Timms",,,STAT MedEvac,,No,No,3/18/18 21:08,Unknown/No documentation in EMS chart,Lay person witnessed,Professional,No,0,7,0,0,0,Bag valve mask,Yes,0,50371287,[document],50395996,[document],50305544,[document],3/19/19 2:05,Admitted to floor (not ICU),,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,"Eyelids open and tracking, or blinking on command",Follows commands,Both reactive,Both present,Present,Present,Not intubated,No TTM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,3/18/18 23:41,1.38,No,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,Yes,3/21/18 18:49,1.31,No,No,No,,,RV failure,,Yes,3/18/18,Yes,4/7/18,,,12,19,No,Long-term acute care,,3,4,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,,,,,,,,,,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Checked,,,,,,Incomplete,,,,,IncompletePUH-2018-167,59,Male,6/13/18,Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,,No,VT/VF,IV,Yes,No,Westmoreland Regional Hospital,Dr. Kristen Gruenther,Rostraver/West Newton Emergency Services,,AHN - Prehospital Response System,,STAT MedEvac,Mr. Bradley Bachman & Mr. Adam Davis,Yes,Yes,6/13/18 11:26,VT/VF,Lay person witnessed,Lay person,No,8,45,34,6,0,New endotracheal intubation,Yes,0,51578304,[document],51578257,[document],51579756,[document],6/13/18 15:08,4G (Neurotrauma ICU),,Unchecked,Checked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Unchecked,Eyelids closed with pain,Myoclonus,Both nonreactive,Neither present,Absent,Absent,"Intubated, over-breathing ventilator",33C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,6/13/18 17:34,1.46,No,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,6/19/18 14:32,Bilaterally absent N20,"Bedside somatosensory evoked potentials in response to bilateral median and tibial nerve stimulation were recorded.

Upper Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral  Median Nerve stimulation:  Results:     Left Median Nerve Stimulation (MS): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 9.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 12.7 ms. The cortical SSEP was not recorded. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the left median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the left inferior brainstem, above which the cortical SSEPs are absent, suggestive of a significant lesion or compression of the somatosensory pathway at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the right side.    Right Median Nerve Stimulation (MD): An evoked potential was recorded at Erb's point at 9.7 ms and at the cervical spine at a peak latency of 14.7 ms. The cortical SSEP was not recorded. Interpretation:         The somatosensory evoked potentials from the right median nerve are within normal limits up to the level of the right inferior brainstem above which, the cortical SSEPs are  absent, suggestive of a significant lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem and/or parietal lobe on the left side.    2. Lower Extremity SSEPs  from bilateral Posterior Tibial Nerve stimulation:  Results:          Left Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TS): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 9.0 ms. The subcortical SSEP was not recorded.  The cortical SSEP was not recorded.  Interpretation:         The peripheral nerve evoked potential from the left posterior tibial nerve was recorded, above which the subcortical and cortical SSEPs are absent, suggestive of a significant lesion or compression at the level of the inferior brainstem on the left side and above the inferior brainstem on the right side.    Right Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TD): An evoked potential was recorded at the popliteal fossa at 8.7 ms. The subcortical SSEP was not recorded.  The cortical SSEP was not recorded.  Interpretation:         The peripheral nerve evoked potential from the right posterior tibial nerve was recorded, above which the subcortical and cortical SSEPs are absent, suggestive of a significant lesion or compressions at the level of the inferior brainstem on the right side and above the inferior brainstem on the left side.     3. Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BSER)  from bilateral auditory, click stimulation:   Left Auditory Stimulation (AS): Waves I, II, III and IV were recorded at peak latencies of  2.4, 3.8, 5.0 and 6.1 ms, respectively. Wave V was not recorded. Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from left auditory stimulation are of poor morphology and are abnormally delayed and the absence of Wave V suggests a significant lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the right side.  Right Auditory Stimulation (AD): Waves I, II and III were recorded at peak latencies of 2.0, 3.5 and 4.7 ms, respectively. Waves IV and V were not recorded.  Interpretation:         The brainstem responses from right auditory stimulation are of poor  morphology and are abnormally delayed and the absence of Waves IV and V suggests a significant lesion or compression at the level of the superior brainstem on the left side.  4. Impression:         The abnormal and absent inferior and superior brainstem responses bilaterally, from TS, TD, AS and AD and the absence of all four cortical SSEPs from MS, MD, TS and TD, bilaterally, is suggestive of multiple diffuse injuries and/or lesions at the level of both the inferior and superior brainstem, bilaterally, and further diffuse injuries/lesions at the supratentorial levels of the parietal cortex, bilaterally.

Overall, this data indicates intact cortical function in the right hemisphere as evidenced by right median nerve SSEP data.  Although, there was no evidence of cortical function with left median nerve SSEP testing, the lack of a subcortical response and a weak ERb's point response raises the possibility of a primary peripheral nervous system lesion.  The lower extremity SSEP study was technically difficult secondary to edema and the lack of responses may be related to technical, rather than phsyiologic, issues.

                            <p>Data are derived from a cohort of patients resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest at a
                                single center. Cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death in high-income nations,
                                including the United States, and reflects abrupt cessation of blood flow and effective
                                cardiac contraction. It may result from more than one <code>etiology</code>, including
                                heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, trauma, respiratory failure or drug overdose. It
                                commonly occurs out-of-hospital (<code>oohca</code>), but may also occur in-hospital. By
                                convention, cardiac arrest occurring in the emergency department (<code>edarrest</code>)
                                is considered an out-of-hospital arrest. A majority of patients at our center are
                                transferred (<code>transfer</code>) from other hospitals. For this reason, initial
                                details about their arrest are sometimes a bit fuzzy. Often, some prognostic features
                                like their initial rhythm (<code>rhythm</code>) are known, but other details such as
                                their total duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (<code>duration</code>), whether
                                they received lay-person CPR after they collapsed (<code>bystander_cpr</code>) or
                                whether their collapse was witnessed (<code>witnessed</code>) are less well defined.
                                Some of these characteristics (e.g., <code>bystander_cpr</code> and
                                <code>witnessed</code>) are only relevant to arrests occurring outside the hospital and
                                emergency department. For the same reason, the exact time of the collapse (<code>arresttime</code>)
                                may be missing, but we can usually ascertain the overall date of the arrest (<code>arrestdate</code>)
                                Our database includes branching logic, so when values are irrelevant they are blank.
                                When categorical variables are unknown, that category is selected. When continuous
                                variables are unknown they take on a value of -1.</p>
                            <p>When patients arrive to the hospital, they typically have several initial prognostic
                                assessments. An initial examination by a physician is summarized as a 4-level ordinal
                                illness severity score (<code>ca_type</code>) (<a
                                        href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636896'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25636896</a>).
                                Type I patients are awake, rarely undergo EEG monitoring, and are typically excluded
                                from by researchers interested in this data set. A CT scan of the brain is often
                                performed as well. We extract certain features from this CT scan, most notably the ratio
                                of grey matter to white matter density (<code>gwr</code>), which is strongly associated
                                with outcome (&gt;= 1.4 is normal, lower is worse).</p>
                            <p>Thereafter, patients are admitted to the intensive care unit, where
                                electroencephalographic monitoring begins (<code>eeg</code>). Although it is started as
                                soon as possible, in reality this occurs on average 8-12 hours after the initial
                                collapse. Monitoring continues for hours to days, and is typically discontinued when
                                either: 1) a patient awakens from coma; 2) a patient dies or shows convincing signs of
                                irrecoverable injury; 3) one to two days pass with no useful information obtained from
                                monitoring; or 4) another patient needs the monitoring device (they are a limited
                                resource). Thus, duration of monitoring is not at random with respect to the clinical
                                setting, but the reason to discontinue observation is not straight forward.</p>
                            <p>Major outcomes of interest in the data set are survival to hospital discharge
                                (<code>surv</code>), awakening from coma while in the hospital (<code>follow_com</code>),
                                and proximate cause of death (<code>death_cat</code>). The former two we have typically
                                combined into a composite binary outcome of &quot;awake and alive at hospital discharge&quot;
                                since patients can often be kept alive indefinitely with aggressive life support even if
                                they have no chance to recover. The latter bears some special consideration. Patients
                                may suffer severe multiple-system organ failure after cardiac arrest and die from events
                                that may or may not be captured in measures of brain activity (e.g., an awake patient
                                with intact brain may suffer a second cardiac arrest). They may also have care withdrawn
                                for reasons that may or may not be related to brain injury (e.g., the elderly patient
                                with a living will who never wanted care in the intensive care unit for any reason).
                                They may progress to brain death (devastating brain injury, but typically easy to
                                identify early on). Finally, they may have care withdrawn for perceived poor
                                neurological prognosis. These patients invariably will die, but some might have
                                recovered in the counterfactual where care had been continued. Thus, the ground truth
                                value for <code>surv</code> is often never observed. In all cases but brain death,
                                prognostic signals may correctly suggest recovery potential despite an observed death.
                                Similarly, algorithms trained to predict prognosis in this cohort must account for these
                                factors to avoid learning to be excessively pessimistic.</p><h5><a name='header-n8'

                            <p>(Electroencephalography) EEG measures brain activity. Raw waveform data reflect the
                                voltage difference between an electrode adhered to the patient&#39;s scalp and some
                                reference (typically either an adjacent electrode or a common average of all the other
                                electrodes). Electrodes are adhered in standard positions, according to the 10-20
                                International System of electrode placement (<a
                                        href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10%E2%80%9320_system_(EEG)'>10–20 system
                                    (EEG)</a>). At our hospital, data are typically recorded at 256Hz from 22
                                electrodes. The data currently stored in our database are features that have been
                                extracted from these waveform data. </p>
                            <p>We used <a href='https://www.persyst.com/'>Persyst</a> to perform signal processing using
                                various mathematical algorithms. Persyst also has algorithms for artifact detection and
                                rejection, and all features have been generated in two forms: with and without artifact
                                rejection applied. These artifacts include both physiological artifacts (e.g.,
                                electromyographic (EMG) artifact from muscle activity and shivering) and
                                non-physiological artifacts (e.g., 60Hz interference from ambient alternating current
                                electrical devices). A total of <code>6037</code> columns containing data at a frequency
                                of <code>1Hz</code> are generated from this signal processing (with a second set of
                                <code>6037</code> generated with artifact rejection). Each column represents a feature;
                                column names are identical for data generated with and without artifact rejection. We
                                tag the data with <code>AR</code> and <code>NoAR</code> for these two method of
                                generation of data, respectively. When data is exported from the database into CSV
                                files, the default setting is to export the <code>AR</code> version. The user can choose
                                between the two forms before exporting from the user interface. This codebook explains
                                the clinical and mathematical meaning of each column. We expect that researchers in the
                                field of data analytics and machine learning would find this document especially helpful
                                in tasks such as feature extraction and correlation exploration. </p>
                            <p>The column names in the database is encoded into a form of <code>Ix_y</code>, where
                                <code>I</code> is the prefix letter, followed by two integers <code>x</code> and
                                <code>y</code> with an underscore between them. All the columns generally falls into one
                                of the 13 categories introduced later. The <code>x</code> values, ranging from 1 to 270,
                                encodes the measurement categories as the following table.</p>

                                    uses an artificial neural network trained on annotated EEGs to estimate the
                                    probability of seizure at any given time from the entire EEG signal. NOTE, this
                                    algorithm was trained on EEGs obtained in epilepsy patients, a fundamentally
                                    different patient population. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of this feature
                                    with regards to a clinical gold standard (expert interpretation) is believed to be

                                <li><p>Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) is one way of describing the overall EEG
                                    amplitude. Very low amplitude EEGs are a sign of injury or dysfunction. Similarly,
                                    extremely high amplitude EEGs may also be abnormal (for example, representing
                                    seizure activity). Importantly, more complex patterns within this feature may also
                                    be highly useful. For example, a pattern of alternating flat EEG and abrupt bursts
                                    of extremely high amplitude activity is a sign of particularly severe brain injury
                                    (burst suppression with identical bursts, see, for example <a
                                            href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982787/' target='_blank'

                                <li><p>For historical reasons, aEEG filters out slow activity (&lt; 1Hz) because this is
                                    uncommon in healthy brains. In cardiac arrest, frequencies from 0-1Hz are more
                                    common and may have greater clinical meaning, making the aEEG estimate of amplitude
                                    potentially troublesome. Other amplitude measures may be more useful (see below:
